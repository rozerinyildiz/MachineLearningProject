# Machine Learning Project
Image processing and classification in Python

### 1- Motivation

Skin diseases are one of the most common health problems in our country and the world. With the developing technology, people have started researching health problems via the internet, as in everything else. For this reason, I believe that machine learning studies on skin disease and the results to be obtained in this way will have an important place in today's technology and this will be developed and offer essential services (mobile app, etc.) to people in various ways.

### 2- Dataset

There are four of the most common skin diseases in my data set that I will use in my project. These;
- melanoma
- rosacea
- keratosis pilaris
- eczema

Since I could not find a dataset about Keratosis Pilaris on Kaggle, I gathered the data from the articles.

### 3- ML problem

Which of these four diseases (melanoma, rosacea, keratosis pilaris, eczema) the data belongs to, accuracy etc. informations.

### 4- Challenges expect to encounter

Some of challenges:
Limited data
Class imbalance
Fixing hyperparameter
